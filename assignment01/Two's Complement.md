**Two's Complement** 
>The two's complement is a method used to represend signed integers on computers. It has the advantage of allowing the fundamental arithmetic operations such as 
addition, multiplication, and subtraction to look identical to when unsigned binary numbers are used with these operations (as long as any overflow bit is 
discarded from the results). This also allows negative and positive binary numbers to be processed in the same circuit without the need for any specialized
hardware to perform subtractions.
