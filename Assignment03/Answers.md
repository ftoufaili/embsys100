**What is Morse Code?**\
Wikipedia defines Morse code as *a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters 
as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.* 
Before telephones were invented, messages were sent over long distances by using pulses of electricity 
to signal a machine to make marks on a moving paper tape. A code was necessary to help translate the marks 
on the paper tape into readable text messages. That's where Morse's code was used to decode these signals. 

**Who developed Morse code?**\
Morse code was developed by Samuel F. B. Morse, who also invented the telegraph.
